## Risk Analysis

### Risks
1. **Platform risk** - Apple/Google could block PWAs

2. **Low adoption** - Developers don't switch
   - *Mitigation:* Make migration dead simple
   
3. **Competition** - Others build similar platforms
   - *Mitigation:* Open source creates moat
   
4. **Legal** - App stores sue for competition
