🚀 LAUNCHING: BlackRoad OS App Store

After months of dealing with Apple's 30% tax and Google's rejection hell, I built my own app store.

Here's what's different:

🧵 Thread 👇

---

1/ The Problem:

• Apple takes 30% of EVERYTHING
• $99/year just to sell apps
• 1-7 day approval (often rejected)
• No control over YOUR business
• Can't even talk to your users

This is insane. So I built an alternative.

---

2/ Introducing: BlackRoad OS App Store

• 0% commission (keep 100% revenue)
• $0 fees forever
• Instant publishing (seconds, not days)
• Never get rejected
• PWA-first (works EVERYWHERE)

No gatekeepers. Just freedom.

---

3/ The Numbers:

If you sell $10,000/month in apps:

Apple: You keep $7,000 (-30% = $3,000 gone)
BlackRoad: You keep $10,000 (0% = $0 gone)

That's $36,000/year MORE in your pocket.

For doing nothing different.

---

4/ Already launched with 50 apps:

✅ Productivity tools
✅ Developer tools
✅ Creative apps
✅ Finance apps
✅ Communication tools
...and 45 more!

All available NOW. No approval needed.

---

5/ How it works:

• Build your app (web, PWA, or native)
• Publish instantly (< 1 minute)
• Users install directly
• You keep 100% revenue
• Update anytime

That's it. No middleman.

---

6/ The Tech:

• PWAs work on iOS, Android, Desktop
• No app store approval needed (it's just a website!)
• Install to home screen = native-like app
• Offline support
• Push notifications
• Everything Apple/Google can do

---

7/ This is open source.

Fork it. Deploy it. Build your own.

The future is decentralized. The future is developer-owned.

GitHub: github.com/BlackRoad-OS/blackroad-app-store

8/ Join the revolution.

50 apps live today.
$0 in fees.
100% freedom.

Stop giving Apple 30% of YOUR money.

🎯 Why I Built My Own App Store (And You Should Too)

After paying Apple $99/year + 30% of every sale, waiting days for approval, and getting rejected for arbitrary reasons, I did the math:

For every $100,000 in app revenue:
• Apple keeps: $30,000
• You keep: $70,000

That's $30,000 just... gone. Every year.

So I built BlackRoad OS App Store:

✅ 0% commission
✅ $0 fees
✅ Instant publishing
✅ No rejections
✅ Total control

Already launched with 50 apps. All PWA-based (works everywhere).

The future isn't gatekeeped. It's decentralized. It's developer-owned.
